How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
It made it easy to spot the mistake.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient

If a mistake is made we can revert to an earlier program and find the problem.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit,
like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
pros it makes logical sense cons its not automatic.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files
in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Git was made with deveopers in mind so they will need that functionality where as
google docs was made more for single file documents.
