When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
to share files with others who are working on the same project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
it could pull things that you are not ready to share.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use 
one instead of another?
forks are kind of like cloning but giving credit to the original and only on github
clones can be cloned directly to your computer from github or another repository.
branches are when you want to break off from the original but keep
the original the same and can be later merged.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
you are able to work off line.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be 
easier, and what would be harder?
I would probably do it with dropbox the only benifit to that though 
would be it is easy to use everything else would be hard because it does
not support the same functionality as git.
